"""Machine check for the project's licensing rules.

Run before every release (wired into scripts/release.sh and the pre-commit
hook) so a license problem can never ship silently.

Rules enforced:
  1. Every core manifest declares `license` and `license_url`.
  2. A non-commercial core is NEVER `bundled` or `download` for any OS —
     free or paid. (Build recipes may exist; binary distribution may not.)
  3. A GPL-2.0-ONLY core is NEVER `bundled` or `download`: it cannot form
     a combined work with this GPL-3.0-only app. A bare GPL-2 LICENSE file
     does not decide this — read the source headers for an "or later" grant.
  4. Blocked holds (`blocked_reason`) ship nothing: delivery absent, no pins.
  5. Every distributed core is listed in THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md.
  6. Every distributed core has at least one pinned artifact.
  7. Every bundled core-art WebP is listed in the artwork provenance record.

`download` distributes the exact same bytes from our release assets as
`bundled` does from the package — every rule above covers both (ADR-013).

Exit 0 = clean. Exit 1 = violations printed.
