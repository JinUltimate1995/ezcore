## Legend

- **B** — built/pinned evidence exists for the stated platform.
- **I** — core identifies/loads in the native harness.
- **R** — content boots, produces frames, and the stated save/restore check
  passes.
- **—** — not verified for that platform.
- **N/A** — not applicable or deliberately absent.
- **Recipe** — build recipe exists, but the upstream license prevents binary
  distribution.
- **Hold** — reserved manifest; never built or shipped.

Controller, save, shader, and cheat columns describe the current application
contract, not independent per-core gameplay proof. The runtime supports
optional save-state symbols and normalized button input; most cores have not
been individually exercised for every feature.

## Matrix interpretation

- The catalog contains 18 active core manifests plus 3 explicit hold slots.
- An em dash in the iOS column means the current committed manifest has no
  iOS artifact pin; older release notes may contain historical build claims.
- “Bundled,” “download,” “recipe,” and “absent” are distribution policy, not
  proof that a core is playable.
- A pin proves artifact identity, not accuracy or gameplay compatibility.
- Per-core boot tests must remain fork-isolated because native cores run
  in-process and can crash the test process.
- Before changing a row, rebuild or run the relevant test and update the
  canonical matrix with the exact command, platform, and limitation.
