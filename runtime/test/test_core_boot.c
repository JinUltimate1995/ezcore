/* test_core_boot.c — boot a core, run frames, save/restore state, verify.
 *
 * Usage: ./test_core_boot <core_path> <rom_path>
 *        EZCORE_BOOT_OPTIONS="key=value;..." optionally sets core options
 *        before the game loads (see apply_boot_options).
 * Exit codes:
 *   0 = pass
 *   1 = load/init failed
 *   2 = load_game failed
 *   3 = no pixels after 30 frames
 *   4 = save_state failed
 *   5 = load_state failed
 *   6 = restore did not reproduce the saved frame (state-fidelity gate)
 *   9 = crash (should not happen; we fork a child)
 *
 * What the RENDERS level of docs/MATRIX.md therefore means, as enforced
 * by this file (read this list as the contract; do not let a printed value
 * stand in for a checked one):
 *   - 30 frames run, and ezcore_frame_pixels() is non-NULL;
 *   - the PRE-restore pixel sum is nonzero (exit 3 otherwise);
 *   - serialize and unserialize both succeed (exit 4 / exit 5);
 *   - the pixel sum of the frame reproduced from the restored state
 *     matches the pre-save sum to within
 *     RESTORE_PIXEL_SUM_TOLERANCE_REL (exit 6 otherwise).
 * A core whose unserialize() returns true but leaves a corrupted
 * framebuffer behind no longer earns RENDERS.
 *
 * Exit-code choice for the new failure: 6, and none of the pre-existing
 * codes fits. 3 means "this core renders nothing at all" and is raised
 * before any state is saved, so reusing it would misfile a broken restore
 * as a broken renderer. 4 and 5 are defined as the serialize/unserialize
 * calls themselves returning false — the exit 5 path is a returned-false
 * branch, and this failure happens strictly after that call returned
 * true, so overloading 5 would make the header document a contract the
 * code no longer keeps. 6 is a new, distinct meaning rather than a
 * silent repurposing of an existing one.
 *
 * Still NOT enforced here (printed only, deliberately out of scope for the
 * state-fidelity gate): the drained audio frame count and the
 * cheat_reset/cheat_set calls. MATRIX.md's IDENTIFIES row is likewise
 * unstrengthened here — see its harness-limits section.

/* How far the post-restore pixel sum may drift from the pre-restore sum
 * before the restore is called broken. Expressed as a fraction of the
 * baseline's magnitude, so it scales with resolution and pixel depth
 * instead of being a magic absolute delta.
 *
 * Why a tolerance at all, and why exactly this one:
 *
 * The pre-restore sum is taken after 30 frames, and the post-restore sum
 * is taken after 30 + 10 + 1 frames from a state saved at frame 30. A
 * faithful restore replays frame 30 exactly, so the two sums describe the
 * same frame and SHOULD be equal bit for bit. They are not required to be
 * equal by this gate because the harness cannot distinguish "the restore
 * lost pixel data" from "the core's renderer is not a pure function of
 * the emulated state" — a core with a time-, host-clock- or RNG-seeded
 * element (blitters reading a host timer, uninitialised RAM rendering as
 * noise) can legitimately redraw a visually equivalent frame with
 * different bytes. Exact equality would grade those cores RED for a defect
 * they do not have, and the fix would then be to weaken the gate, not the
 * core.
 *
 * Why 2% and not 0%, and not a looser 10%:
 *  - 0% conflates the two failure classes above and is the thing this
 *    change exists to stop doing (MATRIX.md's caveat: fidelity is
 *    "unproven"), so it is too weak a contract to ship;
 *  - a sum-based check averages over the whole frame, so a small fraction
 *    of genuinely corrupted pixels moves it very little: at NES-class
 *    256x240, 2% of the sum is on the order of a thousand flipped
 *    low-valued pixels, which is far more than the drift a faithful,
 *    deterministic-but-timed renderer produces (a handful of sprite or
 *    scanline pixels) and far less than total framebuffer loss, which
 *    moves the sum by 100%;
 *  - 10% would let a core that loses, say, a fifth of the framebuffer
 *    still pass. 2% keeps the signal well above the noise floor while
 *    staying far below the "half the screen is gone" regime.
 *
 * This is a deliberately loose smoke gate, NOT a pixel-exactness proof. A
 * core that swaps two equally-weighted sprites can still pass it. Tighten
 * it to 0 for a specific core only alongside evidence that core is
 * bit-exact, never globally and never silently. */
