## The mission

### The emulator should feel like a console.

Not a folder of tools. Not a wall of settings. A **single, beautiful home for
the games you already love** — with the complexity held underneath and the game
kept in front.

That is the ezCORE north star:

> **One library. A growing universe of cores. A simple, polished experience.**

We are building the path from **open your game → press Play → return to your
save** without breaking the experience apart every time a new system, core, or
platform enters the picture.

### Why ezCORE

| Advantage | What it means |
|---|---|
| **A real product surface** | Orbit is designed like a console: responsive, focused, and ready for a living-room display, desktop, handheld, or phone. |
| **Easy to use** | A polished UI/UX keeps the game in front and the complexity out of the way. |
| **One place for your collection** | Your library, systems, saves, screenshots, and preferences live in one coherent experience. |
| **Power without the ceremony** | ezCORE resolves the compatible core path and keeps advanced controls available when you want them. |
| **Local by default** | ezCORE does not require an account, telemetry, or analytics. Your content and saves stay yours. |
| **Built to grow** | New cores, themes, controller layouts, graphics, mods, and platform shells can join the same foundation. |

The interface is the product. Orbit is the first expression of that idea.

---

## Latest progress

### Progress log — 2026-09-24

**Current checkpoint: ezCORE `v0.2.0` — public experimental build.**

The project is moving from “emulator infrastructure” toward a complete console
experience. Recent milestones include:

- **Hybrid core delivery** — large desktop cores can be fetched explicitly and
  are SHA-256 verified before they are staged.
- **A real game library** — validated imports, watched folders, search, filters,
  favorites, recent games, and deterministic cover art.
- **A connected player** — frames, audio, input, pause, fast-forward, reset,
  screenshots, cheats, BIOS guidance, and local saves share one runtime path.
- **Orbit responsive UI** — four layout families, animated space-scene motion,
  reduced-motion support, and shared library state across the shell.
- **A durable project direction** — the roadmap, core matrix, architecture
  state, and verification records now travel with the code.

### The foundation by the numbers

| Signal | Current |
|---|---:|
| Active core manifests | **18** |
| Reserved policy slots | **3** |
| Target platform shells | **5** |
| Responsive layout families | **4** |
| Shared runtime ABI | **1** |
| Native CTest baseline on the current Linux checkout | **3 / 3** |

The numbers are a snapshot, not a finish line. They show the shape of the
platform taking form: one shared surface, many systems, and a growing set of
tools around the game.

For exact platform and core evidence, see [`docs/MATRIX.md`](docs/MATRIX.md).
For the complete direction, see [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md).

## The experience

### Library

A home for the whole collection — not a raw directory listing. Browse by
system, search across games, keep favorites close, and return to what you were
playing.

### Systems

A transparent core catalog with system matching, extension support, license and
provenance information, delivery policy, and pinned artifacts.

### Time Capsule

Local save states with named slots, timestamps, autosave, and per-game battery
save directories. Your return point stays attached to the game.

### Player

A focused play surface for frames, sound, input, pause, fast-forward, reset,
screenshots, live cheat entries, and save/load actions.

### Settings

Local preferences for the way you play: audio, input, storage, appearance, and
emulation behavior.

The imagery below is captured from the real Linux debug build of the current
Flutter shell. Library uses the temporary SameBoy `cgb-acid2` test ROM, Systems
uses the live core catalog with original, unbranded material artwork, Capsule
uses a temporary local save slot, and Settings is the live preferences screen.
Capture data stays outside the repository; no commercial ROMs or proprietary
game artwork are included.

## The road ahead

The roadmap is a sequence of releases, not a wall of restrictions. Each phase
adds another layer to the same experience.

| Track | In the build now | Next destination |
|---|---|---|
| **A beautiful shell** | Orbit navigation, Library, Systems, Time Capsule, Player, Settings, responsive layouts | Richer motion, theme packages, controller skins, TV and handheld shells |
| **One home for more systems** | 18 active core manifests, modular delivery, pinned artifacts, hybrid downloads | More compatible cores, renderer profiles, broader platform coverage |
| **Play without searching elsewhere** | Local cheat entry management, validation, import/export, and live toggles | A first-class Cheat Center with per-game codes, presets, search, and one-tap use |
| **Make it yours** | Orbit tokens and local appearance settings | Complete themes, button layouts, shell customization, graphics packages, and mods |
| **Take your saves with you** | Local Time Capsule, opaque state bytes, per-game SRAM handoff | Backups, version history, portable packages, and optional sync |
| **Play everywhere** | macOS, Linux, Windows, Android, and iOS platform seams | Steam Deck, handhelds, TV/controller-first layouts, and more verified devices |
| **Keep the foundation strong** | C11 ABI, runtime tests, manifest validation, license/provenance gates | Capability discovery, configuration hierarchy, diagnostics, and stronger compatibility evidence |

### The north star

**One emulator to play it all.**

Not by pretending every core behaves identically. By giving every core a
consistent home, a clear capability model, and a UI that makes the differences
feel like features instead of friction.

The full, status-tracked plan lives in [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md). Planned
items are marked as roadmap work; shipped behavior is tracked in
[`docs/MATRIX.md`](docs/MATRIX.md).

## What is working now

The current foundation already connects the important pieces:

- **Game → Play** — the library resolves a compatible installed core and hands
  content to the verified player path.
- **Bring your own content** — file and folder import, ROM plausibility checks,
  SHA-256 deduplication, watched folders, search, and filters.
- **A real player loop** — video frames, PCM audio, keyboard/gamepad/touch
  input, pause, fast-forward, reset, screenshots, and lifecycle handling.
- **Local saves** — Time Capsule slots, autosave, opaque runtime state, and
  per-game SRAM directories.
- **A modular core system** — manifests, licenses, provenance, delivery policy,
  SHA-256 pins, and platform-aware execution data.
- **A cross-platform shell** — Flutter UI with macOS, Linux, Windows, Android,
  and iOS platform seams.

This is the foundation the next chapters grow from.

## Core catalog

The core catalog is designed to grow with the platform. Each core is a
versioned, credited, policy-aware plugin rather than a hidden dependency.

| Family | Systems and ezCORE cores | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Handheld | **Game Boy / Game Boy Color** — `PocketBit`, `Gambatte` · **Game Boy Advance** — `AdvanceBit` | PocketBit is the shipped GB/GBC path; Gambatte remains catalog/policy-only because of its upstream license |
| 8/16-bit classics | **NES / Famicom** — `NesByte` · **Atari 2600** — `Joystick` · **PC Engine / TurboGrafx-16** — `CardCon` · **Super Nintendo** — `SuperFX` · **Genesis / Master System / Game Gear** — `BlastProc` | SNES/Genesis recipes are retained for non-commercial upstreams but are not distributed |
| Disc and 3D consoles | **PlayStation** — `Geometry1` · **Nintendo 64** — `RCP64` · **Nintendo DS** — `DualScreen` · **PSP** — `PortComp` · **Dreamcast / NAOMI** — `DreamArc` · **GameCube / Wii** — `PowerCube` · **Saturn** — `TwinSH` | Several paths require renderer/core-option work before gameplay can be claimed |
| PC and adventure | **DOS** — `RealMode` · **SCUMM / adventure** — `PointClick` | DOS and adventure catalog paths |
| Arcade | **Arcade / Neo Geo** — `CoinBox` | Build recipe only because of upstream distribution terms |
| Reserved policy slots | **Nintendo 3DS** — `citra_hold` · **Nintendo Switch** — `switch_hold` · **PlayStation 2** — `ps2_hold` | Never built or shipped under the current project policy |

Console names are used descriptively to identify compatibility targets; the
names, marks, and logos remain with their respective owners. Cores retain
their upstream licenses and attribution. See
[`docs/CORE_NAMING.md`](docs/CORE_NAMING.md), each
`cores/<id>/manifest.json`, and [`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).

The matrix distinguishes **BUILT**, **IDENTIFIES**, **RENDERS**, and
**SHIPPED** so progress is visible without turning the catalog into a wall of
claims.

## Architecture

The product can grow without turning the UI into a collection of core-specific
special cases.

```text
Flutter / Orbit UI
        ↓
Dart application services + local state
        ↓
Emulation worker isolate
        ↓ dart:ffi
C11 ezCORE runtime · ABI v1
        ↓ libretro C API
Pinned, modular core artifacts
```

The architecture gives the project room to add systems and platforms while
keeping the experience coherent:

- Cores never talk directly to Flutter.
- The runtime owns execution, video/audio, input, cheats, and opaque state.
- Manifests carry provenance, licensing, delivery, execution, BIOS, and pins.
- A shared capability contract is the next foundation milestone.
- Local-first operation remains the default across the product.

Read [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md),
[`docs/CORE_SYSTEM.md`](docs/CORE_SYSTEM.md), and
[`docs/DECISIONS.md`](docs/DECISIONS.md) for the technical direction.

## Build from source

Build the runtime, a core tier, the catalog, and the Flutter shell from one
checkout.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JinUltimate1995/ezcore.git
cd ezcore

scripts/build_core.sh --fetch-headers
scripts/build_runtime.sh macos       # use linux for a Linux build
scripts/build_core.sh --tier1
python3 scripts/build_catalog.py

flutter pub get
flutter analyze
flutter test

# Optional: launch the app
flutter run -d macos
```

Full prerequisites and platform commands are in [`docs/BUILDING.md`](docs/BUILDING.md).
For the native runtime test suite on the current Linux checkout:

```bash
ctest --test-dir runtime/build-linux --output-on-failure
```

---

## Contributing

The next chapter belongs to everyone who wants to shape it.

Useful contributions include:

- A focused bug fix with a regression test.
- A platform verification report from a real device or desktop.
- A core build, provenance, license, or compatibility improvement.
- Public-domain test material with clear provenance.
- UI/UX work that makes the Orbit experience clearer and more delightful.
- Documentation that helps the next person get to **Play** faster.

Start with [`project.md`](project.md), [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md), and
the current [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md). One clear problem per PR keeps the
project fast, reviewable, and welcoming.

Project boundaries are firm: no ROMs, BIOS/firmware, keys, game files, bundled
cheat databases, circumvention tooling, unlicensed cores, held-system cores, or
console trademarks in new project assets.

Use the [pull request template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) and open
issues or discussions through [GitHub](https://github.com/JinUltimate1995/ezcore/issues).
